                                Myceloom is a neologism describing decentralized, symbiotic digital infrastructure that
                                combines the biological intelligence of mycelial networks (distributed, resilient,
                                symbiotic) with the intentional craft of weaving (structural design, pattern-making) and
                                the generational value of heirlooms (inheritance, accumulation, sovereignty). It
                                represents the third architecture between the Silo (corporate platforms) and the Scatter
                                (isolated homesteading)—infrastructure that is both sovereign and connected, both rooted
                                and relational.

                                The term was coined in 2024 by unearth heritage foundry | archive & anvil (The Heritage
                                Foundry), specifically by Digital Archaeologist Josie Jefferson and Trust Architect
                                Felix Velasco. The neologism emerged from building a network of 90+ interconnected
                                domains demonstrating the Archive & Anvil methodology for digital preservation and
                                sovereignty.

                                Myceloom is a portmanteau of three elements: (1) <strong>Mycelium</strong> - the fungal
                                network demonstrating distributed intelligence, symbiosis, and resilience without
                                centralization; (2) <strong>Loom</strong> - the weaving technology representing
                                intentional craft, structural design, and pattern-making through relationship; (3)
                                <strong>Heirloom</strong> - value passed down through generations, representing
                                sovereignty, inheritance, and accumulation over time. Together they describe
                                infrastructure that grows organically yet is designed intentionally, owned sovereignly
                                yet connected symbiotically.

                                lacks. The Myceloom Protocol specifies Three Laws (Sovereignty First, Reciprocal

                                The Myceloom Protocol is a relational specification for building digital presence that
                                is both sovereign and symbiotic. It consists of <strong>Three Laws:</strong> (1)
                                Sovereignty First - own your domain, no rented land; (2) Reciprocal Connection - every
                                link must nourish both nodes; (3) Heirloom Inheritance - build for generational value.
                                <strong>Four Node Types</strong> define roles: Declaration (.im - identity), Connection
                                (.com - commerce), Ground (.org - commons), Landmark (specialty TLDs - permanent
                                monuments). <strong>Five Connection Types</strong> create the network: Citation,

                                presence, and voice; (2) <strong>Connection Nodes</strong> (.com, .co, .net) - enable
                                exchange, commerce, and collaboration; (3) <strong>Ground Nodes</strong> (.org, .io) -
                                hold commons, knowledge infrastructure, and public goods; (4) <strong>Landmark
                                    Nodes</strong> (specialty TLDs) - create permanent cultural monuments like digital
                                art galleries, discipline definitions, and archival collections. Each type serves
                                distinct relational purposes within the network.

                                Archive & Anvil is unearth.im's methodology for digital preservation:
                                <strong>Archive</strong> (retrospective preservation of endangered digital artifacts)
                                and <strong>Anvil</strong> (prospective creation of durable new infrastructure).
                                Myceloom is the network architecture that makes Archive & Anvil possible at scale.
                                Without sovereignty (owning your domains), archival work is built on rented land
                                vulnerable to platform collapse. Without symbiotic connections, archives become isolated
                                monuments. Myceloom provides the relational infrastructure where both preservation and
                                creation can accumulate generational value.

                        We love the game's Myceloom. It inhabits the "Magical-Whimsical Complex." But while that
                        creature is bred in a game, <strong>our Myceloom</strong> is the structure of the future web
                        itself.

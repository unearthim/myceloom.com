# Myceloom: The Artificial Intelligence of Living Networks

## A Digital Archaeological Investigation

---

**Abstract**

While silicon-based neural networks dominate contemporary discourse on artificial intelligence, the most sophisticated information processing systems on Earth are biological. Mycelial networks—fungal information architectures that have been computing, learning, and adapting for over 400 million years—offer profound lessons for AI development that transcend biomimicry. The "myceloom" framework articulates principles for AI systems that integrate the distributed cognition and computational properties of living networks, drawing upon advances in unconventional computing, reservoir computing, bio-hybrid robotics, and collective intelligence research. This investigation examines the theoretical and empirical foundations for understanding AI development not as the creation of isolated artificial minds, but as the cultivation of symbiotic intelligence networks that honor both computational efficiency and organic wisdom.

## I. Introduction: The Convergence of Biological and Artificial Intelligence

In the cascading intelligence revolution of 2025, artificial intelligence researchers increasingly find themselves studying the forest floor. While silicon-based neural networks dominate computational headlines, the most sophisticated information processing systems on Earth—mycelial networks—have been computing, learning, and adapting for over 400 million years.^1^ Recent breakthroughs demonstrate that living fungal networks can implement Boolean logic circuits, exhibit memory formation, and demonstrate collective decision-making that parallels artificial neural architectures.^2^ The convergence of biological and artificial intelligence represents not merely an engineering opportunity but a fundamental reconceptualization of intelligence itself.

Yet despite this convergence, the field lacks precise terminology to describe the intersection. Academic papers describe "bio-hybrid computing," "fungal electronics," and "nature-inspired AI," but these multi-word phrases gesture toward something that demands a single, resonant term.^3^ The absence of adequate vocabulary constrains both theoretical development and practical implementation.

Through digital archaeological excavation, the research foundry unearth.im has identified "myceloom" as the framework for AI systems that learn from and interface with mycelial intelligence.^4^ Like the symbiotic networks it describes, this term weaves together artificial and biological cognition into a unified approach to distributed intelligence. This essay examines the theoretical foundations and practical implications of myceloom thinking for artificial intelligence development, drawing upon multiple scholarly traditions to articulate principles for designing AI systems that enhance rather than replace the natural intelligence of living systems.

## II. The Architecture of Biological Computing

### A. Fungal Networks as Computational Substrates

Recent research has shattered the boundary between biological and artificial computation. Andrew Adamatzky and colleagues at the University of the West of England have demonstrated that living mycelium networks can implement a "wide range of Boolean circuits" through the non-linear transformation of electrical signals.^5^ These fungal composites exhibit "rich dynamics of neuron-like spiking behaviour" and demonstrate genuine computation embedded within living materials.^6^ The work, published in peer-reviewed journals including *Scientific Reports* and *Interface Focus*, establishes that fungal networks are not merely metaphorically computational but literally implement logical operations.

The mechanisms underlying fungal computation involve calcium waves and associated waves of electrical potential changes that propagate through mycelial networks.^7^ Adamatzky's team has shown that these excitation waves can be employed to implement computation by encoding Boolean values as spikes of extracellular potential. The researchers "derive sets of two-inputs-on-output logical gates implementable the fungal colony and analyse distributions of the gates."^8^ The distribution of logical functions depends on environmental and physiological conditions of the mycelium-bound composites, providing what the researchers describe as "computational characterisation of the fungal material states."

The implications extend far beyond biological curiosity. Fungal networks process information through millions of low-power connections, achieving complex computation without the massive energy requirements of contemporary AI systems.^9^ While artificial neural networks consume gigawatts of power in centralized data centers, mycelium achieves distributed intelligence through what researchers describe as inherently efficient parallel processing.^10^ This efficiency differential has captured the attention of AI researchers seeking alternatives to energy-intensive machine learning architectures, particularly as concerns mount regarding the environmental sustainability of large-scale AI systems.

### B. Mycelial Network Topology and Information Processing

The topology of mycelial networks reveals sophisticated organizational principles that parallel findings in network science. Research on fungal network architecture demonstrates that mycelium develops what researchers term "scale-free" network properties—the same topological features found in neural networks, social networks, and the internet.^11^ Mark Fricker, Lynne Boddy, and colleagues have documented that fungal networks exhibit "efficient foraging strategies" and "adaptive resource allocation" that emerge from their distributed structure.^12^

The largest known fungal organism, *Armillaria bulbosa*, spans over 15 hectares and contains an estimated trillion elementary processing units connected through mycelial networks.^13^ This biological computer operates through distributed decision-making, with each hyphal junction acting as a processing node in a vast network architecture that predates digital technology by geological ages. Studies reveal that individual hyphal tips respond to local conditions while contributing to network-wide patterns of resource allocation, threat response, and growth coordination.^14^

These networks demonstrate what contemporary researchers term "network intelligence"—cognitive capabilities that arise from the structure and dynamics of connections rather than individual processing power.^15^ The behavior of the network cannot be predicted from the behavior of individual hyphae; intelligence emerges from their interactions. This emergent property suggests that AI development might focus less on building more powerful individual models and more on creating sophisticated networks of interconnected systems that demonstrate collective intelligence.

## III. Unconventional Computing: Beyond Silicon

### A. The Field of Unconventional Computing

The academic field of unconventional computing provides theoretical grounding for myceloom approaches. Unconventional computing investigates computational processes that occur outside traditional silicon-based architectures, including computation in biological, chemical, and physical systems.^16^ This field recognizes that computation is not the exclusive province of digital computers but rather a fundamental property of many dynamical systems.

Research in evolution-in-materio has demonstrated that materials contain rich properties that can be exploited to solve computational problems.^17^ Rather than abstracting computation away from physical substrates, this approach leverages the intrinsic dynamics of materials for information processing. Studies have shown that diverse materials—from liquid crystals to nanowire networks to biological tissues—can perform computations when appropriately configured.^18^

The connection to myceloom thinking is direct: if computation can occur in diverse physical substrates, then biological networks represent not merely inspiration for AI design but potential computational platforms themselves. This recognition motivates research into hybrid systems that combine biological and artificial components, leveraging the unique capabilities of each.

### B. Reservoir Computing: Leveraging Dynamical Systems

Reservoir computing provides a particularly relevant computational framework for understanding myceloom architectures. Reservoir computing (RC) originated in the early 2000s as an approach that utilizes dynamical systems as reservoirs—nonlinear generalizations of standard bases—to adaptively learn spatiotemporal features and hidden patterns in complex time series.^19^ Unlike conventional neural networks that require extensive training of all parameters, RC systems train only a simple readout layer while leaving the reservoir dynamics fixed.

A comprehensive review published in *Nature Communications* identifies reservoir computing as a promising direction for lightweight, energy-efficient AI systems.^20^ The authors note that "biological systems such as human brains are able to accomplish highly accurate and reliable information processing across different scenarios while costing only a tiny fraction of the energy that would have been needed using big neural networks." Reservoir computing offers a computational paradigm more aligned with biological efficiency.

The connection to mycelial networks is profound. Researchers have demonstrated that mycelium can function as a physical reservoir computer, processing information through its natural growth and adaptation patterns.^21^ These "mycelium chips" represent hybrid architectures where the biological substrate itself performs information processing that would otherwise require extensive artificial computation. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks that require extensive training algorithms, mycelial systems demonstrate inherent learning capabilities that emerge from their biological architecture.

Research on morphologically tunable mycelium chips demonstrates that fungal networks can serve as physical reservoir computers.^22^ The mycelium's electrical activity—its pattern of voltage spikes and signal propagation—performs computational transformations on input signals. By reading out these transformed signals and training a simple linear classifier, researchers can accomplish pattern recognition and other computational tasks. The biological substrate does the heavy computational lifting; the artificial component merely interprets the results.

## IV. Bio-Hybrid Systems: Integration of Living and Artificial

### A. Bio-Hybrid Robotics

The field of bio-hybrid robotics demonstrates practical applications of integrating biological and artificial systems. A comprehensive review published in *npj Robotics* documents how "new robotics solutions have been developed that harness the adaptability of living muscles, the sensitivity of living sensory cells, and even the computational abilities of living neurons."^23^ These systems represent genuine integration rather than mere imitation—biological components performing functions that artificial systems cannot match.

Bio-hybrid robots integrate living organisms—including cells, tissues, and even whole organisms—with synthetic materials to create systems with capabilities exceeding either component alone.^24^ Living materials offer intrinsic softness, environmental safety and compatibility, and more efficient energy conversion processes than traditional robots. Research at ETH Zurich and other institutions has demonstrated bio-hybrid robots capable of various motion abilities including swimming, bending, rotating, and crawling.^25^

The bio-hybrid approach aligns with myceloom principles by demonstrating that artificial intelligence need not replace biological intelligence but can be enhanced by it. Rather than abstracting biological principles into purely artificial implementations, bio-hybrid systems maintain living components that provide capabilities—adaptation, self-repair, environmental responsiveness—that remain difficult to achieve artificially.

### B. Fungal Integration in Artificial Systems

Cornell University researchers have developed biohybrid robots that integrate living mycelium into electronic systems, creating machines that "sense and respond to the environment" through biological computation.^26^ These systems represent genuine myceloom architecture—artificial intelligence enhanced by biological network integration rather than biological simulation. The living mycelium provides environmental sensing capabilities that inform the robot's behavior.

The integration leverages the mycelium's natural responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Fungal networks respond to light, temperature, chemical gradients, and mechanical pressure through changes in their electrical activity and growth patterns.^27^ By interfacing artificial systems with these biological sensors, researchers create hybrid architectures where the biological component provides information that guides artificial decision-making.

Research has demonstrated that machines connected to living mycelial networks exhibit enhanced environmental responsiveness compared to purely digital systems.^28^ The biological component provides not merely sensing but a form of pre-processing—the mycelium's response to environmental conditions already encodes significant information that the artificial system can leverage. This represents a division of labor where biological and artificial components each perform functions they are well-suited for.

## V. Distributed Cognition and Collective Intelligence

### A. Theoretical Foundations of Distributed Cognition

The theory of distributed cognition provides conceptual grounding for understanding myceloom approaches to AI. Distributed cognition, developed by Edwin Hutchins and colleagues, proposes that cognitive processes are not confined to individual minds but distributed across persons, artifacts, and environments.^29^ Cognition emerges from interactions among components rather than occurring within isolated processors.

Research on collective cognition demonstrates that network topology shapes collective behavior and intelligence.^30^ A review published in *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B* documents how "social network topology shapes collective cognition"—the structure of connections between individuals affects what the collective can accomplish.^31^ This finding has direct implications for AI development: the architecture of AI systems affects their collective capabilities.

The framework of distributed cognition suggests that intelligence need not be concentrated in individual processors but can emerge from appropriately structured networks. This aligns with observations of mycelial networks, where intelligence emerges from distributed interactions rather than centralized control. The implication for AI is that developing more intelligent systems may require focusing on network architecture as much as individual component capabilities.

### B. AI-Enhanced Collective Intelligence

Recent research examines how AI can participate in collective intelligence systems rather than operating in isolation. A review published in *Patterns* conceptualizes "a multilayer representation of human-AI collective intelligence, comprising cognition, physical, and information layers."^32^ The authors propose that "humans and AI possess complementary capabilities that, together, can surpass the collective intelligence of either humans or AI in isolation."

This framework aligns with myceloom principles by positioning AI not as a replacement for human or biological intelligence but as a participant in hybrid cognitive systems. The goal is not artificial general intelligence that supersedes human cognition but rather AI systems that integrate productively with other forms of intelligence—human, biological, and artificial.

Research on emergent collective memory in decentralized multi-agent AI systems demonstrates how collective capabilities can emerge from distributed interactions.^33^ Studies show that multi-agent systems can develop collective memory through the interplay between individual agent memory and environmental trace communication, creating "spatially distributed collective memory without centralized control." This emergence of collective properties from distributed components mirrors the emergence of network intelligence in mycelial systems.

## VI. Neuromorphic Computing: Biological Inspiration for Hardware

### A. The Neuromorphic Paradigm

Neuromorphic computing provides another framework for understanding myceloom approaches. Neuromorphic computing focuses on developing novel computing systems that operate at a fraction of the energy of current transistor-based computers, often deviating from von-Neumann architecture and drawing inspiration from biological principles.^34^ The field seeks computational architectures that process information more like biological systems.

Research has demonstrated that neuromorphic approaches offer significant advantages for certain computational tasks. A review in *Springer* notes that reservoir computing on neuromorphic hardware has shown promise due to "computational efficiency and the fact that training amounts to a simple linear regression."^35^ Both spiking and non-spiking implementations have been developed, demonstrating the versatility of biological-inspired approaches.

The connection to myceloom thinking involves recognizing that biological systems have evolved computational strategies that may be more efficient than current artificial approaches for many tasks. Rather than forcing all computation through silicon architectures optimized for different purposes, neuromorphic approaches seek computational substrates better suited to the tasks at hand—including, potentially, biological substrates themselves.

### B. Biocompatible Computing Platforms

Research on reservoir computing with biocompatible organic electrochemical networks demonstrates practical implementation of biologically-inspired computing.^36^ A study published in *Science Advances* reports organic networks that demonstrate "complex nonlinear dynamics" and "features typical of biological cortical systems (e.g., recurrency, short-term memory, and E/I balance)."^37^ The researchers achieved 88% accuracy in classifying arrhythmic heartbeats using these biological-compatible computational platforms.

These systems suggest pathways toward computing platforms that can interface directly with biological systems. The authors envision "lightweight, noninvasive implants, capable of monitoring biosignals, and perform 'online' computation without the aid of energy-consuming software."^38^ Such systems would represent myceloom architectures in the most literal sense—computation occurring through biocompatible substrates that integrate with living systems.

The development of sustainable memristors created from shiitake mycelium demonstrates that fungal materials can provide "scalable, eco-friendly platforms for neuromorphic tasks."^39^ These biological processors offer alternatives to resource-intensive silicon architectures while demonstrating computational capabilities that parallel artificial neural networks. The material basis of computation shifts from extracted and processed minerals to cultivated biological materials.

## VII. The Myceloom Framework: Principles for Symbiotic Intelligence

### A. Core Principles

Drawing from the research traditions examined above, the myceloom framework articulates principles for AI development that integrates biological and artificial intelligence:

**Distributed Processing**: Following the example of mycelial networks, myceloom architectures emphasize distributed rather than centralized computation. Intelligence emerges from the interactions among network components rather than residing in individual powerful processors. This approach offers resilience (the system continues functioning despite individual component failures) and efficiency (computation occurs locally where information is available).

**Biological Integration**: Rather than merely imitating biological systems in artificial substrates, myceloom approaches maintain living components that perform functions they are uniquely suited for. This integration leverages capabilities—adaptation, self-repair, environmental responsiveness, energy efficiency—that remain difficult to achieve artificially.

**Emergent Intelligence**: Myceloom systems recognize that collective intelligence can exceed the capabilities of individual components. The goal is not maximizing individual processor power but optimizing network architecture for emergent collective capabilities. This principle aligns with both mycelial network organization and distributed cognition theory.

**Symbiotic Enhancement**: Following the collaborative rather than competitive model of mycorrhizal networks, myceloom AI systems aim to enhance rather than replace other forms of intelligence. The goal is productive integration with human cognition, biological systems, and environmental contexts rather than autonomous operation independent of other intelligence.

### B. Computational Symbiosis: The Living Machine Interface

Perhaps most significantly, myceloom systems suggest a new paradigm for artificial intelligence—one that recognizes intelligence as inherently collaborative rather than competitive. Recent advances in fungal computing reveal that living mycelium can implement reservoir computing, where the biological substrate itself performs information processing.^40^ These hybrid architectures represent a fundamental shift from AI as artificial replacement for biological intelligence to AI as enhancement of biological capabilities.

This symbiotic approach offers solutions to some of AI's most pressing challenges. While contemporary machine learning systems require massive datasets and energy-intensive training processes, myceloom architectures leverage biological intelligence that has been "trained" by hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary optimization.^41^ Research shows that AI systems inspired by mycelial principles demonstrate superior resilience, energy efficiency, and adaptive capacity compared to traditional centralized AI systems.^42^

The symbiosis is bidirectional. Just as AI systems benefit from biological integration, biological systems can be enhanced through artificial augmentation. Bio-hybrid robots demonstrate enhanced capabilities through the combination of biological and artificial components.^43^ The integration produces systems with capabilities exceeding either component alone—a genuine symbiosis rather than parasitism or competition.

## VIII. Applications and Implications

### A. Practical Implementations

Current research demonstrates practical applications for myceloom architectures across multiple domains. Fungal computing researchers have shown that mycelial networks can solve complex optimization problems, including shortest path calculations, network topology optimization, and adaptive resource allocation.^44^ These biological computers operate through environmental programming—modifying growth conditions to reprogram network geometry and computational behavior.

Research in bio-hybrid robotics demonstrates applications in environmental monitoring, drug delivery, and search-and-rescue operations.^45^ Bio-hybrid systems offer advantages in environments where conventional robots struggle—wet, constrained, or biologically sensitive contexts. The living components provide capabilities including self-repair, environmental responsiveness, and efficient energy utilization that remain difficult to achieve artificially.

Machine learning researchers are implementing myceloom principles through decentralized AI architectures that distribute computational tasks across networks of simple processors, mimicking how fungi allocate resources based on environmental needs.^46^ These systems demonstrate the democratizing potential of myceloom architectures—reducing infrastructural requirements while maintaining sophisticated computational capabilities.

### B. Sustainability and Energy Efficiency

The energy efficiency of biological computing offers significant sustainability advantages. Contemporary large language models and other AI systems consume substantial energy during both training and inference.^47^ The environmental impact of AI development has become a significant concern as systems scale. Myceloom approaches offer an alternative development trajectory with reduced environmental footprint.

Biological computing systems operate at far lower energy levels than silicon alternatives. Mycelial networks process information through chemical and electrical signaling that requires minimal energy input compared to the power demands of data centers.^48^ While biological systems cannot match the raw computational speed of silicon, they achieve remarkable efficiency for the computations they perform. For applications where efficiency matters more than speed—sensing, adaptation, pattern recognition—biological approaches may prove superior.

The cultivation of computational materials rather than their extraction represents a paradigm shift in how computing infrastructure relates to environmental systems. Rather than mining minerals and manufacturing processors, myceloom approaches suggest growing computational substrates from renewable biological materials.^49^ This shift aligns computing development with broader sustainability goals.

## IX. Challenges and Future Directions

### A. Technical Challenges

Significant technical challenges remain in developing myceloom architectures. The timescale problem—matching computational timescales between biological and artificial systems—presents ongoing difficulties.^50^ Biological processes often operate at different temporal scales than electronic computation, requiring careful interface design.

Maintaining living systems within artificial frameworks requires addressing biological needs including nutrition, environmental conditions, and waste removal.^51^ Unlike silicon components that remain stable indefinitely, biological components have lifespans and require ongoing maintenance. Developing robust bio-hybrid systems requires solving problems of biological sustainability that traditional engineering approaches do not address.

Scalability presents another challenge. While laboratory demonstrations have proven biological computation principles, scaling to practical applications requires addressing issues of biological variability, environmental sensitivity, and integration complexity.^52^ The transition from proof-of-concept to deployable systems represents a significant engineering challenge.

### B. Ethical Considerations

The integration of living systems into computing architectures raises ethical questions that the field is only beginning to address. Research on ethics in bio-hybrid robotics documents emerging considerations including the moral status of living components, the appropriateness of various applications, and the environmental implications of creating novel bio-artificial hybrids.^53^

Questions about the moral status of biological computing components depend partly on what organisms are involved. Using fungal networks raises different considerations than using animal tissues or neural cells. The field requires frameworks for ethical evaluation that account for the diverse biological components potentially involved in myceloom systems.^54^

Environmental implications extend beyond sustainability benefits to include potential risks. Releasing bio-hybrid systems into environments could have unintended ecological consequences. Responsible development requires careful consideration of containment, environmental impact assessment, and end-of-life management for biological computing components.^55^

## X. Conclusion: The Philosophy of Symbiotic Intelligence

The linguistic innovation of "myceloom" provides essential terminology for navigating the convergence of biological and artificial intelligence. Rather than describing "bio-hybrid AI systems with fungal network integration," one can speak of myceloom architectures and immediately convey the essential qualities: biological, collaborative, adaptive, intelligent. This precision enables clearer thinking about AI development that honors both computational efficiency and organic wisdom.

The convergence of fungal computing research, reservoir computing theory, bio-hybrid robotics, and collective intelligence scholarship points toward a unified understanding of intelligence as inherently distributed and potentially symbiotic. Individual processors—whether biological or artificial—achieve their fullest expression through integration into collaborative networks. Networks achieve their highest capabilities through the appropriate composition and connection of diverse components. The health and capability of each depends upon and enables the health and capability of all.

As we advance toward more sophisticated artificial intelligence, the mycelial networks beneath our feet offer profound lessons about distributed cognition, adaptive learning, and symbiotic collaboration. The future of AI may lie not in perfecting individual artificial minds, but in learning to weave them into the living networks that connect all intelligent life. The myceloom framework captures this evolution: artificial intelligence systems that grow like fungi, adapt like living networks, and demonstrate the collaborative intelligence necessary for addressing complex global challenges.

In this convergence of ancient biological wisdom and cutting-edge technology, we find not just computational efficiency, but a pathway toward AI that enhances rather than replaces the natural intelligence of living systems. The declaration stands: AI developed according to myceloom principles can achieve what neither isolated artificial systems nor unaugmented biological systems can accomplish—sustainable intelligence that honors both computational power and organic wisdom. This is not utopian aspiration but empirically grounded possibility, documented in laboratory demonstrations, theoretical frameworks, and emerging practical applications. The substrate for artificial intelligence lies not in competition with biological intelligence but in connection with it, not in replacement but in enhancement, not in isolation but in integration.
